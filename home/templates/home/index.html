                    <p class="text-black hover basic hover">
                        Light bouncing off the glass of your digital screen results in creating a glaring obstacle to proper vision. This computer screen glare increases the difference between the dark and lighter areas displayed. This, in turn, often causes our pupils to struggle to keep up to the light by dilating continuously,  until eventually our eyes protest. That’s where Computer glasses come in. These special glasses feature an Anti-glare coating, designed in a way to keep the fatiguing screen glare at a minimum.

                    <p class="text-black hover basic">
                        Many a times, we peer over our glasses or hunch closer to the device to get a better view of the computer screens. But we all know this isn’t helping. Computer glasses help you get a clearer vision from a normal distance that ultimately reduces the need to strain on your back and neck. This can also reduce the headaches you get when you strain your eyes way too much and also with a bad posture.

                       Exposure to the harmful Blue Violet radiations emitted by the Computer screens may cause problems like eye strain, sleep cycle disruption and even macular degeneration in some cases. You can also opt for Computer protection glasses with yellow tinted lenses that increase the contrast and help in protecting your eyes from harsh lights of the computer screen.

                       Computer glasses usually correct astigmatism – a type of refractive error that causes blurry vision. Drop by the Coco Leni Optical store near you to consult an optometrist and get the best advice possible for the same. We take precise measurements for your lenses that ensures that the optical center of each lens lays in front of your pupils when you use it.
